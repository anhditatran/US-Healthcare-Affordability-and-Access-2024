## Healthcare Affordability & Access Analysis (U.S.)

This project analyzes how **insurance status, income, and geography** shape healthcare affordability and access in the United States. Using large-scale public health data and interactive Tableau dashboards, the analysis evaluates whether having health insurance actually reduces cost barriers—and which populations remain most vulnerable.

## Key Questions

* Does health insurance meaningfully improve healthcare affordability?
* How do affordability and health outcomes differ by **insurance type**?
* What role do **income** and **geography** play in access to care?
* Where do structural gaps persist despite insurance coverage?

---

## Data Sources

* **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2024**

  > National survey of 400,000+ adults covering insurance, health status, costs, and preventive care
* **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) 2024**

  > Administrative data on provider availability, mortality, and geographic health disparities

---

## Analytical Approach

* Built **four Tableau dashboards** to examine affordability from multiple dimensions:

  1. **Insurance & Affordability** – insured vs uninsured and by coverage type
  2. **Health Outcomes & Prevention** – access, preventive care, and reported health
  3. **Geography** – rural–urban provider gaps and early death rates
  4. **Income** – affordability and access across income levels
* Validated findings against external sources (KFF, Gallup, HRSA, Census)

---

## Key Insights

* Insurance improves affordability overall, but **coverage alone is not sufficient**.
* **Medicare/Medigap** consistently shows the strongest affordability and access outcomes.
* **Medicaid/CHIP and Marketplace plans** still leave many adults facing cost barriers.
* Working-age adults and low-income groups experience the greatest affordability challenges.
* Rural areas face significant **primary care shortages**, limiting access regardless of insurance.
* Higher income strongly correlates with better health and fewer cost-related barriers.

---

## Why This Matters

* Highlights **structural gaps** in the U.S. healthcare system that insurance does not fully address
* Identifies populations at highest risk of delayed or skipped care
* Supports data-driven discussions around **policy design, provider allocation, and cost protection**
* Demonstrates how analytics and visualization can inform **public health and resource planning**

## Tools

Tableau, public health datasets (BRFSS, CHR&R), data validation with external benchmarks

---

## Takeaway

Insurance reduces healthcare costs for many Americans, but **income and geography continue to drive unequal access and outcomes**. Addressing affordability requires not only broader coverage, but stronger financial protection and improved provider availability—especially for low-income and rural communities.
